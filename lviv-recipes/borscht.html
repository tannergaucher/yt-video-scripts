    You'll need beets, cabbage, carrots, potatoes, onions, garlic, beans, beef
    or vegetable broth, tomato paste, vinegar, and optional herbs and spices.

    Finely chop the onions and mince the garlic. Grate the beets and carrots.

    In a large pot, heat some oil and sauté the onions until translucent. Add
    the garlic and sauté for another minute until fragrant.

    Add the grated beets and carrots to the pot and cook until they soften and
    release their vibrant colors. Stir in the tomato paste and cook for a few
    more minutes.
